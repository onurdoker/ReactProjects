        React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook, widely used for building user interfaces, particularly
        for single-page applications (SPAs). It follows a component-based architecture, enabling developers to create reusable and
        independent UI elements. React’s Virtual DOM optimizes performance by updating only the necessary parts of the real DOM.
        JSX, a syntax resembling HTML, simplifies code writing. React Hooks streamline state and lifecycle management in
        functional components. With its vast community, rich ecosystem, and flexibility, React is a powerful tool for modern web
        development. It’s often paired with frameworks like Next.js for enhanced functionality.
